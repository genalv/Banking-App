## Use localStorage

- You may use a button somewhere in your application page that when pressed should load the initial data to the localStorage
  This will help you, and other visitors on you Github Page, to immediately test the capabilities of your banking app
  Note: localStorage across different pages will only work on your Github Pages because it depends on the domain.
